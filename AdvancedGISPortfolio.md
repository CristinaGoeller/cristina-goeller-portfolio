### Methodology & How to Use

This map is created for the New York Leauge of Concervation Voters. I interned for them my junior year of undergrad, so I reached out to my former boss to get insights on what kinds of maps they would need in the coming months. They primarily use these maps for two things: visualizing how "green" a region is and traking blighted infrastructure (particularly buildings and led pipes). For the purposes of this assignment, I chose to make it for the more detailed blighted infrastructure. They also have a preference for a darker basemap because it helps to highlight key communities of interest for redevelopment. 

Aubergine was used as a base and the colors were tweaked to have a more natural color pallate that the Leauge perfers. I ended up using ChatGPT to understand what it would look like with the colors I selected. See below:

The materials here can be used in Google Maps, ESRI, and other map making software in order to have a consistent basemap for the organization. The JSON file, linked below, can be uploaded into the software to auto-populate. Another option is to manually input the colors by going into the advanced settings option and following the hex codes in the table.

### Dark Color Palette with NYLCV Greens

This color palette is designed to align with NYLCV's environmental theme, incorporating dark colors with NYLCV greens for various map features.

- **Deep Forest Green**: `#1B4D3E`  
  
- **Dark Olive Green**: `#3D6B47`  
  
- **Muted Teal**: `#4A7B6C`  
  
- **Charcoal Gray**: `#2B2B2B`  
 
- **Deep Plum**: `#4E2A4A`  
  
- **Golden Olive**: `#A8903D`

### Map at Three Levels
As established, this map is going to be used to look at blighted infrastructure. Therefore, I used zoom extents that were at the most regional. 
This final section gives an overview of the base map at three levels: 

_Overview of Long Island_

Zoom Estimate: 1:2,000,000
