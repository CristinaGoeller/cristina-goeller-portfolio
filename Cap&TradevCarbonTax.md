Carbon Tax](Cap&TradevCarbonTax)

Synopsis: This project presents a cost-benefit analysis of different carbon emission reduction policies for Pennsylvania power plants, including Cap & Trade, a Carbon Tax, and a Carbon Limit, compared to no intervention. The analysis aims to inform power plants about the economic impacts of these policies to aid their preparation and lobbying efforts. It evaluates the effectiveness of each policy in reaching a targeted 30% emission reduction by 2040, utilizing a 2% social discount rate and considering the social cost of carbon. The findings suggest that Cap & Trade is identified as a beneficial option due to its flexibility and predictability for power plants in managing emission targets.
