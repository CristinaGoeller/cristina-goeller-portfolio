Synopsis: In partnership with Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, we conducted an analysis of the Climate Toolkit, a network of Gardens, Museums, and Zoos working to take climate action within their communities. The primary goals of this study were to better understand how members are engaging with the Toolkit and identify potential areas to enhance resources.
