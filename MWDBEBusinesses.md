# GIS Final Project
For my final project in Graphical Information Systems, I created a storymap of MWBE Businesses! It assesses walkability from subway stations to MWDBE Businesses across the city. At the end of the ArcGIS project, I included a call to action for policymakers to better understand subway usage patterns in order to more optimally distribute future subway stations.
