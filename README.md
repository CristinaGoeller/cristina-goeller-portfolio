# About me
Hi! I'm Cristina(she/her)---a second-year Masters Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm from Long Beach, New York. It's a small, barrier island-city off Long Island. We are mainly known for our beach and producing some A1 surfers and swimmers. It's a cool spot to hang out in the summer---we're a 45 minute LIRR ride from Manhattan! Outside of school I surf, kickbox, cook, and play too many instruments to list here. 

In this degree program, I am concentrating in Urban Economic Development. When I explain what I'm studying to my family members, I just say "Well, problem solving. Everything from workforce development, corportate-social responsibility, infrastructure development, etc. I use data collected on these topics to help the government make more informed decitions about place-making." I intered on the Equity team at the New York City Economic Development Corporation over the summer! (I'm keeping a running tab of how many times I bring up New York each semester---we're at 26).  

I also work at the campus-wide Sustainability Initative where I run programming for students and try to get student's excited about sustainability in their careers/lives. This semester I am working on three big projects: Storytelling for Sustainability (a roundtable discussion-style event where we highlight different stories of students/faculty/yinzers centered on the idea of how where we come from inflluences what we do); Metamorphasis: A Storytelling Art Exhibit (an art competition with Phipps concervatory for young people in Pittsburgh to submit their work to be displayed at Phipps Concervatory); and the Voluntary University Review (a review of sustainable actions on campus).
