# Welcome! 
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  After my final project is complete, I'll upload all the cool work I have done during my time here at Heinz.

# About me
Hi! I'm Cristina(she/her)---a second-year Masters Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm from Long Beach, New York. It's a small, barrier island-city off Long Island. We are mainly known for our beach and producing some A1 surfers and swimmers. It's a cool spot to hang out in the summer---we're a 45 minute LIRR ride from Manhattan! Outside of school I surf, kickbox, cook, and play too many instruments to list here. 

In this degree program, I am concentrating in Urban Economic Development. When I explain what I'm studying to my family members, I just say "Well, problem solving. Everything from workforce development, corportate-social responsibility, infrastructure development, etc. I use data collected on these topics to help the government make more informed decitions about place-making." I intered on the Equity team at the New York City Economic Development Corporation over the summer! (I'm keeping a running tab of how many times I bring up New York each semester---we're at 26).  

I also work at the campus-wide Sustainability Initative where I run programming for students and try to get student's excited about sustainability in their careers/lives. This semester I am working on three big projects: Storytelling for Sustainability (a roundtable discussion-style event where we highlight different stories of students/faculty/yinzers centered on the idea of how where we come from inflluences what we do); Metamorphasis: A Storytelling Art Exhibit (an art competition with Phipps concervatory for young people in Pittsburgh to submit their work to be displayed at Phipps Concervatory); and the Voluntary University Review (a review of sustainable actions on campus). If you guys need to be connected to any resources, feel free to email me or come up to me before/after class. I'm hard to miss I have big curly hair---haha :) 

# What I hope to lear.n
Super excited to be here! I ended up in this class beacuse, at my internship over the summer, my boss created these incredible visualizations to go with her powerpoints and I was like "damn, I gotta learn how to do that." I've done a ton of data presentations over my academic career, and it has been something I have been a little insecure about. I think when someone is able to wrap up their work in a pretty package, it shows how much they take pride in their work. So, that's why I'm here. 

Broadly I would want to come out of this class with a better technical understanding of how to use color, shape and texture to convey an idea.

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
In 2021, I created two reports for the Nassau County Comptroller: Sustainability 2030 Master Plan and The Deal for Gen Z: Changing Demographics in Nassau County. Both of these reports skimmed the surface of data visualizations. For my project, I want to tell the story of how Nassau County's demographics---and therefore needs---are changing.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
