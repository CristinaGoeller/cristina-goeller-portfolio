# About me

Welcome! As a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon's Master of Science in Public Policy and Management program, my work sits at the intersection of urban economics, housing policy, and data-driven analysis. 

Through projects like my "Telling Stories with Data" project, which analyzed housing affordability in Nassau County, and my "Sustainable Business Strategy Project," which explored using investments in affordable housing to address the wealth gap, I've developed a deep passion for finding innovative and equitable solutions to complex urban challenges. My portfolio showcases how I apply rigorous research and analysis to create tangible, positive impacts in communities.
