Synopsis: 
Big Bankâ„¢ is exploring strategies to address the wealth gap through targeted investments. This case study examines potential initiatives, drawing inspiration from JPMorgan Chase's commitment and considering the legal and reputational landscape around DEI efforts. Proposed investments focus on children's savings accounts and financial literacy, affordable housing through community land trusts, and supporting small businesses via revolving loan funds, with Pittsburgh identified as a pilot location. The analysis includes key performance indicators, cost estimations based on existing programs, and considerations for potential risks and their mitigation. Ultimately, the document argues for a proactive approach to DEI investing, highlighting the potential for positive social impact and long-term benefits for the bank.
