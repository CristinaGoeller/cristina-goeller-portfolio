## Step two: the critique
This chart attempts to show the changing composition of what country US imports are coming from overtime.It is clear that Mexico and Canada has overtaken the exports.  I do believe they start the time scale in the 90s because that is where the trade agreement started---and this works very well. Having it overtime to see the impact of the policy is a very cool idea, but I had to read the article in order to understand that fact. In other words, it is treated as a nuance when it should be front and center. They use a description note at the bottom to describe they chose any country with an above 2% share of imports. While this gives the reader insight into the scale of the graph, I think the space would be better used to describe the trade agreement made between CA, MX and the US. Those not in the present day top 3 are highlighted in a color while those 2% are in grey. I think this also works well, but I would make those small importers into one category "Other."

The primary audience for this graph would be the average NYtimes reader. Usually college educated with an interest in the Trump Administration's tariffs and wanting to learn more. I do think this is moderately effective. While the major  conclusion is that Mexico and Canada are in the top 3 importers, there is more that this graph wants to communicate that gets lost because it contains too many factors. In other words, the eye travel makes it so I would rather just note the top 3 importers in 2024 and move on to read the article. 

There are three recommendations I have for this graph: First, group all of the 2-4% category into one "Other" category. Next, I would change the Title/Subtitle to be more descriptive. "Share of Imports to the US by County (1992-2024)" "A trade agreement in the 90s allowed for the North American countries to more freely trade. The Trump Administration's Tariffs stand to undo this progress." Third, I would change the colors to be more eye popping.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

**MEIM Mid-Twenties**

What do you think this is? 

A flowchart with a timeline that shows the percent of imports the US gets from each country.

What do you think it’s telling you? 
Some shares of Canadian and Mexican goes up overtime. 

Is there anything you found confusing? 
The flowchart. I was more focused on how this must've been difficult to make than what it was telling me—it was overly complicated. She noted not knowing where to look. 

Who do you think is the intended audience for this? 
People trying to understand how tariffs will impact the US. 

Is there anything you would change or do differently? 
Noted she liked the colors and agreed with what the PPM said about the simplification. 

**MSPPM Mid-Twenties**

What do you think this is? 
Timeline of where the US gets its imports from. 

What do you think it’s telling you? 
Mexico, Canada and China are in the top 3 and have been that way for a while. 

Is there anything you found confusing? 
Agreed with the flowchart note and added: There aren’t any lines that distinguish between when NAFTA or Tariffs started, so the message is unclear. Also it’s hard to match the year with the final percentage. 

Who do you think is the intended audience for this? 
Americans trying to understand where we get our goods from. 

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
She noted she would add grid lines to show where trade agreements happened—maybe splicing it into 5 year periods. Also, she would get rid of the flow chart overall to make it an area line chart.

**Major Themes**

Confusion with the Flowchart: Both participants found the flowchart format confusing and overly complex, hindering their understanding of the data.  The first interviewee focused on the difficulty of creation, while the second specifically mentioned the lack of clear connection between the timeline and the final percentages.  This suggests the flowchart was a significant barrier to effective communication.

Missing Contextual Information:  A crucial missing element was the lack of context regarding trade agreements like NAFTA and the implementation of tariffs.  The second interviewee explicitly pointed this out, noting the absence of any visual cues to indicate when these policy changes occurred.  This absence made it difficult to interpret the trends in import sources in relation to these significant events.

**New Sketch Post Feedback:**

In this second iteration, I attempted to simplify the graph and hone the topic. A better point to make here that fits in the narrative of the article is that where the US imports from has changed overtime; However, that doesn’t necessarily mean the US is becoming more self-reliant. The added black line shows the inflation adjusted $ spent on imports overtime as well—showing an increase from the 2000s to 2024. I also dropped the NAFTA dimension because it is distracting from the major takeaway. 


## Step five: build the solution

**Concluding Thoughts**

I chose to do this visualization because of the timeliness of the issue: The Trump Administration’s imposition of tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Their major rationale for this imposition is it will make the United States more self-reliant. However, this graph attempts to show that, even after the implementation of tariffs on China in 2019, the amount spent on imported goods continues to increase exponentially. 

This critique process was really helpful in honing down how to leveredge the data to make the most relevant conclusions. I originally wanted to try to keep the flowchart and thought the main issue was too many countries being presented at once. However, the reality is the flowchart was not the best visualization type to get to inform that the US will not become more self-reliant because of tariffs. I also really appreciated the note of delineating between time frames. The original graph had too wide of a span of time to understand the major point, and it led to further confusion. Starting at the early 2000s—when the impacts of NAFTA were at their height—helps to contextualize the era of modern American history that needed to be focused on. At the end of this process, I found it really rewarding to sketch something and then have it come to life using Tableau.
