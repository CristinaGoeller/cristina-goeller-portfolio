# Changes made since Part II/Final Design Decisions
> There are two changes I have made since part II. First, the audience where I originally wanted to focus this towards politicians to get them moving on interventions. I ended up switching it to the citizenry of Nassau because I felt awareness and education of these issues is an important first step. In undergrad, I interned at the local Comptroller's office where I authored policy reports detailing issues going on in Nassau. I ended up getting a lot of feedback from citizens explaining their experiences and ideas for interventions. I thought this would be a great edition to that series (unfortunately it does not exist anymore online because of the new comptroller). In order to tailor it in this way, I made the design decisions to highlight key statements in each section to make it more skimmable, and changed the color scheme to Nassau County's colors for branding.

> The other major change I made was the framing, and this also has to do with the change in audience. I wanted to do more storytelling than just the introduction, so I used another anecdote from my own experience in the first section, my dad's observation on segregation in the final section, and leveredged the story of a Black veteran denied a home. With the addition of these three components, I feel like it reads less like an academic paper and more human.
> What I really wanted Nassau residents to get out of reading the story is their experience is valid and data baked. There is a narrative in a place like Nassau that if you do not make enough to at least break even that it is intrinsically an individual issue. In other words, it is the fault of the person for making "bad decisions." In reality, there are legacy structural issues in place to keep Nassau exclusionary and we need to address those issues before placing any kind of blame on the individual.
> Finally, I was really trying to strike a balance here between being formal and informal. I wanted it to be approachable so people could follow, but complex enough to give people a jumping off point to do more research. This I still struggle with in submitting this final draft, and will be something I revisit in the future. Perhaps there should be two iterations of this: one like a fact sheet and the other like a broader data story.

## The audience
> The audience for this data story is the citizenry of Nassau County. 

## AI acknowledgements
> Used AI for brainstorming, outlining and organization.

# Final thoughts
> Overall this experience was really interesting. I found a ton of gaps even in my own knowledge that were filled though writing this presentation. The major focus of being here in grad school is understanding the built enviornment and how barriers inhibit the outcomes of people. Getting to put a story to it really makes me more confident that I have a better understanding of it since coming to Heinz. I have mixed feelings about growing up in Long Beach. However, I am grateful that it has given me the disernment of understanding that if something does not feel fair it usually is not fair.

>  If I had more time, I would have loved to build out the section on segregation more. I think the story I ended up with is great and can stand alone, but I also think I could have separated it into two stories to do a deeper dive on both of those issues to supplement the analysis in the final data story. Moreover, I would have liked to work in the Hurricaine Sandy angle more. There are not I am surely most excited about sending the final copy to my parents and family friends who still live in Nassau. It will be really cool to see what their reactions are to the final story.
