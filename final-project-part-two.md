## Interview findings

| Question | MISM Student | Public Policy Student | Community Resident (Nassau) |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **What is the main takeaway or message you got from the story? (Did it align with my intention?)** | Understanding geographic disparities and housing conditions, highlighting social stratification. | The story effectively illustrated the relationship between historical housing policies and socioeconomic disparities. | It showed how neighborhood setups affect people’s lives and opportunities, reflecting real experiences. |
| **Who is the intended audience?** | People of Nassau, urbanism and policy enthusiasts, those interested in structural racism and segregation. | Urban planners, policymakers, community activists, and those interested in city development and social impacts. | Nassau residents, especially those unaware of historical influences, and housing decision-makers. |
| **Was there enough data to make the story convincing? Was there too much?** | Enough data, especially liked the user interview component. | Data was balanced well between quantitative (census figures) and qualitative (interviews). | Plenty of facts and figures, but not overwhelming. The interviews were powerful. |
| **Did the story explain the data effectively, or did it just present numbers?** | The story had a strong data presence but explained it thoroughly. | Visualizations were clear, and the narrative contextualized the numbers well. | Charts and maps were helpful, with explanations in plain language. |
| **What is one thing I could improve to make the story even stronger?** | Include data on second homes. | Add case studies of communities that successfully tackled similar housing challenges. | Include more voices from different parts of the community. |
| **Do you have any other suggestions or comments?** | Look at cities that successfully desegregated as a call to action. | A follow-up exploring policy interventions or community-led initiatives would be interesting. | This story needs to be seen by more people—it’s important for awareness. |


# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

| Research Synthesis                       | Anticipated Changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Successful desegregation case studies**: Interviewees suggested looking at cities that have effectively addressed housing disparities. | Incorporate case studies from cities to illustrate potential solutions in the call to action. |
| **Impact of second homes on local housing**: An interviewee pointed out the need for more data on second homes and their influence on affordability. | Look into the impact of second-home ownership on Nassau’s housing market and determine whether it is a significant factor in affordability. If so, include relevant data and analysis. |
| **Enhancing data visualization**: Interviewees found the data helpful but suggested making it more engaging and easier to interpret. | Improve visual storytelling by using interactive maps, historical overlays, and before-and-after comparisons to make the data more compelling and accessible. |


## Final Thoughts

Since last week, I reframed how I am approching the story. I ended up interviewing my dad to learn more about how the island has changed from a first person perspective and get some anecdotes to sprinkle throughout the data story. 

When I boil the story down, it is really talking about how Nassau County's affordability looks completley different based on your social class, race, and/or place of origin. I ended up not having to make as many maps as I anticipated because there is a tool called the Long Island Historical Index that creates them for most of the factors highlighted. I also included morre sketches to have something together for the critique because the original data source I had was not producing the data that I thought it was. It kept pulling historical data from back in the 1800s and that was not representative of the time frame I am lookimg at here.
